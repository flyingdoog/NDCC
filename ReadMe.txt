This repo contains many debug/previous/redundancy codes. Just for your reference.
I will consider cleaning a released version upon request.
For comparison, you can use the demo link, which you can find the disambiguation results of all names in the AMiner Datasets.

You can follow the description in our paper for pre-processing steps.

If you find any bugs, please contact me at dul262@psu.edu.
